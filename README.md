Welcome to fitlog
======

fitlog is a simple, intuitive fitness tracking application for individuals that have a love of many different sports and are looking for an easy way to quickly track their activities.  Unlike other fitness apps, fitlog focuses on the 10 second use case.  In other words, just tracking that you did your workout.  Now, like any great infomercial, **_That's not all_**.  Using fitlog, you will be able to select your favorite activities, record sessions, enter additional detail, follow friends, request and obtain validation of activities, among other things.

In the end there are many, many (and many and many...) fitness apps.  We hope this one proves interesting due to its sheer simplicity.  Thank you for stopping by.

# Using the project
Nothing special here, unless you aren't familiar with CocoaPods, but be sure to always use the .xcworkspace file when opening the project in Xcode.

# Motivation
fitlog is the brainchild of B.J. Ray and is being brought to life through the combined contributions of B.J. and Ryan LaMountain (UX extraordinaire). It is a simple and modest iOS based project that incorporates several technologies that we just wanted more familiarity with.  In addition, we hope it provides an example of our capabilities in this space.  Hopefully there will be some interesting things within this project for you to find.  Some of those are:
* Use of CocoaPods
* Examples of TDD
* Automated builds
* Use of a backend REST service (StackMob)
* UIAppearance
* iOS 7 features, in general


# Goals
Personally, we hope to illustrate good design and development skills in this project.  This should span both the external interface and the code inside.  One pattern I hope to practice in this project is the avoidance of checking for nil.  To put more clearly, to not focus on the absence of something, focus on having a case (i.e a success) for "nothing".  I've picked this up from a Podcast by the guys over at Thoughbot.

# Roadmap
Well, its hard to say and I'm sure it will evolve, but here is what we are thinking...
* Bluetooth integration with a Polar HR monitor
* Integration with popular fitness tracking apps like Strava and Nike+.
* Leaderboards
